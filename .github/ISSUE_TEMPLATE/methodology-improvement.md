**Which part of the methodology does this affect?**
Select all that apply:
- [ ] Phase 1: Design
- [ ] Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Phase 3: Review
- [ ] Phase 4: UAT
- [ ] Phase 5: Triage
- [ ] Phase 6: Production
- [ ] Regeneration Cycle
- [ ] Planning Documents (00-07)
- [ ] Principles
- [ ] SSRDD / Scaling
- [ ] Other (describe below)

**Describe the current behaviour**
What does SRDD currently say or do in this area? Include references to specific sections if possible.

**What's the problem?**
Why is the current approach insufficient, unclear, or suboptimal? What failure mode or friction have you observed?

**Proposed change**
Describe your proposed improvement. Be as specific as possible — include revised wording, new steps, or structural changes.

**Rationale**
Why would this change improve the methodology? Include any evidence from:
- Your own experience applying SRDD
- Observed patterns across projects
- Alignment with established software engineering principles
- Feedback from teams or collaborators

**Impact assessment**
- Does this change affect other phases or principles?
- Would this require updates to templates or tooling?
- Is this additive (new guidance) or a revision (changing existing guidance)?

**Alternatives considered**
What other approaches did you consider? Why is this proposal better?

**Additional context**
Add any other context, diagrams, or examples that support your proposal.
